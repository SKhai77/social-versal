## Description

The purpose of this project is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list by using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. MongoDB is chosed for this project over SQL as it is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
